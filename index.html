							<p>Hi, I’m Kris and I am an Australian from the SE suburbs of Melbourne VIC with English as my only spoken language.
								  In 2000 I finished my VCE along with a few tafe certifications in IT, since then I have studied off and on with
									 some vendor specific certs such as CompTIA Network+ (Teams et al., 2019) which I achieved in 2012 and have also
									  trained online with CBTNuggets (CBT Nuggets, 2019) for the cisco CCNA, Microsoft server and exchange server
										 but did not complete the certification track due to workload.</a>.</p>

							<h2>Interests In I.T.</h2>
							<ul class="inner">
							<p>I have always had an interest in IT since around the age of 8 which was sparked by my first computer, the commodore amiga 64.  Since then I had grown up with having computers and laptops which at the time in the 80’s and 90’s was not such a common thing unlike today.  At the age of 12 I started to work on computer hardware which lead to starting my first business at 16 as a pc builder.  Once I finished school I moved away from the IT world to work in the trades to which I eventually started working for a physical security company (CCTV, alarm, access control) which was heavily IP based and re sparked my interest in working with IT.</a>.</p>
							<p>I chose to come to RMIT through Open Universities Australia as I work full time and this course allows me to study 100% online around my schedule.</a>.</p>
							<p>I expect to learn more of the programming side to IT along with a good background in cybersecurity as this is the direction I am heading.</a>.</p>

						<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
						<ul class="inner">
						<p>My ideal job would be CTO, a leadership position that looks over the big picture managing all ins and outs of the technology space which is appealing to me as I strive to reach the top position and have a passion for managing people, systems and projects on every level.</a>.</p>
						<p>This position requires proven leadership and ability to manage large number of staff and teams as well as have a good working knowledge in software development and hands on programming skills.</a>.</p>
						<p>Currently I have good management skills as I am the national installation, service and warehouse manger at my current job with around 5 years of experience.  I have a good background in IT and software but will need to work on further skills to progress to this role.  Obtaining the bachelor of IT is the first step toward this goal.  Moving forward I will have to undertake further programming and management courses to back up my experience with certifications.</a>.</p>

				    <p>The results of the tests below all coincide together and form a picture of my overall personality and confirm what I believe to be true about myself in that I am a natural leader and am following the correct path to further my career moving toward the goal of becoming a CTO.
							Test results have shown that I will work well as both a participant in a team along with taking on a managing role within the team environment.
							When forming a team I will be looking to make contact with other students by taking a proactive approach and reaching out to other people that have skillsets which would work well together.</p>

				<h2>Project Idea</h2>
				<ul class="inner">
					<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>The smarter connected home Hub.</a>.</p>
				<p>This project is to bring together many types of different smart technologies found in the home and place them all into a single hardware and software driven application rather than having to control them via the use of several different apps or devices.  The smarter connected home should be streamlined to make life easier for the end user whilst integrating fully into one’s day to day life.  At the same time automating processes around the home to work together seamlessly through machine learning and AI technology.</a>.</p>
				<h3>Motivation</h3>
				<p>Whilst we live in a world lined with technology these days it is not as cohesive as it could be.  Currently your home may contain some smart lighting, an electronic door lock or a range of other smart driven devices, what would make the smart home even smarted would be if these devices could work together as a whole from a single app.  Smart devices currently work mostly independent or with limited ability to connect to a single platform.  Through the use of some fairly simple hardware design and software we could take control of these devices to work together.</a>.</p>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>The smarter connected home hub and app would combine current smart devices along with other electronics that do not have smart technology and put them together in a single platform.  </a>.</p>
				<p>Starting with the front door, we can take a security camera and couple this with the use of machine learning services to identify faces or people and then integrate this with the electronic door lock so that as a person approaches the front door, they will be detected and the door will automatically unlock.  Depending on the time of day this could then lead to turning on the house lighting in common areas and setting the inside temperature based on current weather conditions.</a>.</p>
				<p>If a familiar face is detected a notification can be sent to your phone or device which would ask if you would like to remotely unlock the door to let them in.</a>.</p>
				<p>The possibility would be endless with user customisable automations which could be programmed in a simple to use interface within an IOS or Android device.  The smarter home app would have the ability to control television and home theatre using existing smart hardware and integrating with software.</a>.</p>
				<p>A geotag could be used to shut down all lights or electronics that are on if all users have left the house or specific electronics based upon the user.  When everyone has left the house this could trigger the alarm system to activate and protect saving you the extra time and frustration of logging in to another piece of hardware.</a>.</p>
				<p>The hardware would be an expandable set of zone inputs and relay outputs that could control things such as electronic blinds, garage doors, outdoor lighting or sprinkler systems and the list of possibility is endless when it comes to devices that can be controlled via relay inputs.  Zone inputs can be used to monitor the state of devices or sensors such as ambient light or motion.</a>.</p>
				<p>Having all of the technology working together on a single platform will also enable the smarter hub to be controlled via one of the already popular working voice activated smart assistants as opposed to individual smart devices connecting to these existing platforms directly.  The difference would be that not all devices can be connected to one single platform as they are often designed with a single platform in mind.  The smarter hub will support all devices with the ability to be controlled by voice via your smart assistant of choice.</a>.</p>
				<p>To summarize the smarter home hub would be an app controlled device with the capability of connecting all smart devices together along with other technologies and equipment to simplify the use of these devices through a single app and the use of smart automation without the need to run multiple apps and settings.</a>.</p>
				<h3>Skills Required</h3>
				<p>The skills required to make this project work are as follows:</a>.</p>
				<p>This will require learning a programming language in order to program an application for a portable device or computer as well as writing a program that uses either the API if available from existing smart devices or custom script to interface. As well as firmware for the hub hardware.</a>.</p>
				<p>The hub would be a specially designed piece of hardware to control non smart enabled devices and will need skills in electronics to build.</a>.</p>
				<p>The hardware would not be too difficult to build however the software development will require a lot of knowledge and skill and would be undertaken by a team.</a>.</p>
				<h3>Outcome</h3>
				<p>If this project were to be successful this would eliminate the need for having to install multiple apps for controlling different smart devices and would allow control over equipment that traditionally would involve using physical switches or hardware to control.  The project would take complex tasks and put them into an easy to use and understand single app that could be used by anyone no matter what age or with limited knowledge or technical ability.</a>.</p>
