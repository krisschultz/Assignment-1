							<p>Hi, I’m Kris and I am an Australian from the SE suburbs of Melbourne VIC with English as my only spoken language.
								  In 2000 I finished my VCE along with a few tafe certifications in IT, since then I have studied off and on with
									 some vendor specific certs such as CompTIA Network+ (Teams et al., 2019) which I achieved in 2012 and have also
									  trained online with CBTNuggets (CBT Nuggets, 2019) for the cisco CCNA, Microsoft server and exchange server
										 but did not complete the certification track due to workload.</a>.</p>

							<h2>Interests In I.T.</h2>
							<ul class="inner">
							<p>I have always had an interest in IT since around the age of 8 which was sparked by my first computer, the commodore amiga 64.  Since then I had grown up with having computers and laptops which at the time in the 80’s and 90’s was not such a common thing unlike today.  At the age of 12 I started to work on computer hardware which lead to starting my first business at 16 as a pc builder.  Once I finished school I moved away from the IT world to work in the trades to which I eventually started working for a physical security company (CCTV, alarm, access control) which was heavily IP based and re sparked my interest in working with IT.</a>.</p>
							<p>I chose to come to RMIT through Open Universities Australia as I work full time and this course allows me to study 100% online around my schedule.</a>.</p>
							<p>I expect to learn more of the programming side to IT along with a good background in cybersecurity as this is the direction I am heading.</a>.</p>

						<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
						<ul class="inner">
						<p>My ideal job would be CTO, a leadership position that looks over the big picture managing all ins and outs of the technology space which is appealing to me as I strive to reach the top position and have a passion for managing people, systems and projects on every level.</a>.</p>
						<p>This position requires proven leadership and ability to manage large number of staff and teams as well as have a good working knowledge in software development and hands on programming skills.</a>.</p>
						<p>Currently I have good management skills as I am the national installation, service and warehouse manger at my current job with around 5 years of experience.  I have a good background in IT and software but will need to work on further skills to progress to this role.  Obtaining the bachelor of IT is the first step toward this goal.  Moving forward I will have to undertake further programming and management courses to back up my experience with certifications.</a>.</p>

				    <p>The results of the tests below all coincide together and form a picture of my overall personality and confirm what I believe to be true about myself in that I am a natural leader and am following the correct path to further my career moving toward the goal of becoming a CTO.</p>
